# Aims - What does this package do?

This package is a collection of functions that crop up often in producing tables
for Social Security Scotland statistical publications. These tools fall broadly 
into the following categories:

* wrangling data - changing the structure of data, e.g. transposing data frames
* augmenting data - creating new useful columns, e.g. bucketing by age band or local authority
* summarising data - automating common summary processes, e.g. adding total by financial years
* tidying tables - getting tables publications ready, e.g. rounding and suppressing data 

# Future development areas - What doesn't this package do? (yet!)

Currently there are no tools in this package to help with the following jobs. Please help by 
suggesting or adding these! Also feel free to suggest tools that aren't in the areas listed 
below - all ideas welcome!

* data import
* excel output and formatting - there is currently another package in development 
to do this. Get in touch if you are interested by contacting any of the package administrators
