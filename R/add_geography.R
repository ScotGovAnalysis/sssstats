#' add_geography Adds geography fields from the Scottish Statistics Postcode Lookup
#'
#' @description
#' Selects relevant geography fields from the Scottish Statistics Postcode
#' Lookup for all Social Security Scotland official statistics publications.
#' As this lookup does not contain the local authority name, we need to join
#' the local authority names from the data zone 2022 lookup. To add Scottish
#' Index of Multiple Deprivation columns the 2011 datazones are needed.
#'
#' Then, after cleaning the postcodes, those geography fields are added to the
#' target data frame by joining via the postcode column.
#'
#' There are some postcodes that cannot be matched to any version of the
#' Scottish Statistics Postcode lookup, and thus those postcodes cannot be
#' assigned to the relevant geography area (e.g. a local authority area etc.)
#' Therefore, postcodes would be assigned to:
#'
#' - 'Unknown - Scottish postcode' if its postcode area is identified as
#'    Scottish postcode
#' - 'Unknown - Non-Scottish postcode' if it meets the UK standard postcode,
#'  but its postcode area is not identified as Scottish postcode
#' - 'Unknown - Others' if it does not meet the UK standard postcode.

#'  Function defaults to using a config file for the path to the sspl file
#'  (uses config$sspl) but if a path is given as as the third argument in the
#'  function call then the function will use that instead. This means a config
#'  file is not essential for use.
